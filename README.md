# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

This repository is for understanding, defining and exploring the concept of Requirement Analysis.


## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the functional and non-functional requirements of a software system. It serves as the foundation for building software that meets business goals and user expectations.

The goal of requirement analysis is to ensure that all stakeholders — including clients, end-users, developers, and project managers — have a clear and shared understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform. This clarity guides the entire development p

rocess and helps reduce miscommunication, costly rework, and project delays.

Key components of requirement analysis include:

- **Understanding stakeholder needs and expectations**
- **Defining what the software should do (functional requirements)**
- **Describing how the system should behave (non-functional requirements)**
- **Documenting all findings in a structured format**
- **Validating the requirements through reviews and acceptance criteria**

In essence, requirement analysis acts as the blueprint for successful software development, ensuring that the end product aligns with user needs and project objectives.
